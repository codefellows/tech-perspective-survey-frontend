I am a professional rubix cube doer by trade and am making a shift to something more challenging. I am also a father of two kids and I like extremely long walks in the woods. I really enjoy solving problems within code, and my goal is to become an average coder someday. In my spare time I like taking things apart, building computers, and taco bell.",
